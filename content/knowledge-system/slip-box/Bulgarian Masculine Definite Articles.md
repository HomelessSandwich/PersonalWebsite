There are two different [definite articles](Definite%20Article.md) for masculine words. Words ending in a constant will use the -ът article when they are the subject of the sentence. Words will end with -а when they are the object.

Examples:

 > 
 > "Мъж**ът** говори" - The man is talking
 > 
 > "Аз говоря с мъж**а**" - I'm talking with the man
