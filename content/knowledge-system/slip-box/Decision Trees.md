A decision tree is a tree of statements and with decisions based on whether or not the statement is **true** or **false**.

    A --> |False| C[Go somewhere else then!]

If the statement is **true** then you go left and *vice versa*. A question on a feature can be asked multiple times. The same goes for final classifications.
