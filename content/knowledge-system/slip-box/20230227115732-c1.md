When splitting a decision tree, the number of samples that the leaves on a branch can possess can become quite low. This can make it hard to be sure that the leaf will do a good job of making good predictions.

This can be dealt with by:

* *Pruning*
* Putting limits on how [trees grow](20230227115732-c.md) by setting a threshold of the number of samples required to split a leaf

Example:

````mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Loves popcorn\nSamples: 100]
    C[Does not love the song\nSamples: 80]
    D[Loves cats\nSamples: 20]
    E[Loves the song\nSamples: 19]
    F[Does not love the song\nSamples: 1]

    A --> |True| D
    A --> |False| C

    D --> |True| E
    D --> |False| F
````
