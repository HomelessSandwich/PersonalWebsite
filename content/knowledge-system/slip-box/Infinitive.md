Infinitives are a special form of [verbs](Verb.md) that can be used as a [noun](Noun.md), [adjective](Adjective.md) or [adverb](Adverb.md). They are usually made by adding the word *to* before the base verb. They are useful when discussion actions without actually doing the action:

* I want to go home.
* I like to write in English.

Example:

* I need **to win**.
* Today, we win.

In the first sentence, the infinitive form of the [verb](Verb.md) *win* is used. The main [verb](Verb.md) of the sentence is actually "need". The second sentence uses the standard form of *win* as an actionable [verb](Verb.md). In he first sentence with the infinitive, the action of "winning" is not actually done. The sentence simply discusses the idea of winning. The second sentence however, describes the action of winning.
