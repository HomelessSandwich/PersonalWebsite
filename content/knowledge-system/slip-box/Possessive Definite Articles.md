When the [short possessive pronoun](Short%20Possessive%20Pronouns.md) is used, it is placed after the word they are referring to. That word will also become a [definite article](Bulgarian%20Definite%20Articles.md).

Examples:

 > 
 > "Кучето ми не харесва ябълки" - My dog doesn't likes apples
 > 
 > "Кучето им харесва ли ябълки?" - Does their dog like apples?
 > 
 > "Колата Ви е тук" - Your car is here
