Asking a closed question (one that can be answered with yes or no) is quite simple.

* Use the ли particle, usually added after the verb
* With the verb to be (съм) in the present tense, it is placed before

Examples:

* Има ли котка? - Is there a cat?
* Имаш ли куче? - Do you have a dog?
* Момче ли си? - Are you a boy?
