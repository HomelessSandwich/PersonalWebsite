It is a rule that you cannot start a sentence with a present form of the verb *съм* ("to be"). When you omit the subject personal [pronoun](20230129210911-a.md), the [verb](20230129214114.md) has to move into the second position:

* "Аз съм мъж" or "Мъж съм" – I am a man

It is incorrect to say: "съм мъж"
